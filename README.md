# WorkAssist

WorkAssist is an Android application designed to streamline the process of connecting home service workers with customers in need of their expertise. Service providers such as plumbers, electricians, cleaners, and more can register, set their availability, and showcase their contact details. Customers can easily find and contact these workers based on location, timing preferences, and service requirements, facilitating efficient communication and service booking.
